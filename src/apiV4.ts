     * See [betterplace.org clients](../README.md#client-api).

     *
     * ### Process Flow
     *
     * [This flow chart describes the process…](https://ixwphj.axshare.com/donation-pledge-flow.html).
     *
     *
     * ### What if the donation receiver is fully funded?
     *
     * The donation will be booked in the receiver account even
     * if the receiver is fully funded. The receiver will than show a
     * progress percentage > 100 %. For a project that means, the project
     * manager has to add new money needs to pay out the additional funds.
     *
     * Please note that a closed project is prohibited from receiving donations.
     *
     *
     * ### What if the donation receiver is prohibited from receiving donations?
     *
     * At the time when the pledge is received the system does not check the receiver
     * status. Therefore the API will always respond with a success message for all
     * receivers. Should the receiver be prohibited from receiving donations at the
     * time when the donation is processed, the donation will be redirected to a
     * specific client donation pool. Clients can later forward this money to
     * projects they choose.
     *
     *
     * ### Reconciliation of donation pledges
     *
     * Part of the contract for the usage of this donation pledge API will
     * be the time period in which the pledges need to be reconciled. Ususally
     * every two weeks or once a month. At the end of this time, the client
     * will sum all pledges in the client system, wire us the donations and
     * also send us a CSV file which allows betterplace.org to check the amounts.
     *
     * The fields for the CSV files are:
     * - receiver_type, eg. `Project`
     * - receiver_id, eg. `1114`
     * - amount_in_cents, eg. `12000`
     * - client_reference, eg. `123123123123`
     * - datetime (ISO8601 with Timezone), eg `2007-11-01T13:15:30Z`
     *
     * Please use these names as column titles, use utf-8, use ","
     * as a separator and force double quotes around all values.
     *
     * Here is [a flow chart describing the process](https://ixwphj.axshare.com/money-transfer-flow.html).
     *
     *
     * ### Sending donation pledges to the client-pool
     *
     * It is possible to send donation pledges directly to the client-pool, by
     * submitting to this endpoint instead of the project specific one:
     *
     * `POST https://api.betterplace.org/de/api_v4/clients/{CLIENT}/pool/donation_pledges.json`
     *
     * This endpoint will respond and behave like described above, but the
     * money will be stored on the pool. Clients can later forward this money to
     * projects they choose.
     *
     *
     * ### Response and error codes:
     *
     * [A list of all response and error codes](../README.md#http-status-codes).
     *
     * The most likely ones are:
     *
     * [HTTP Code **`202`**](http://httpstatus.es/202)
     * if a resource was successfully submitted for delayed processing.
     * A successful request will return HTTP status 202 (accepted). The
     * donation pledge is now saved and queued and will be processed
     * by background workers. This part takes place asynchronously and might
     * take up to a few minutes, especially in high traffic scenarios.
     * Please make sure that you queue and retry your API calls until you
     * receive clear answer (202, 422, 404, etc.) from us.
     * Note that we will book only one
     * donation per <code>client_reference</code> so there's no need to
     * worry about retrying the pledge-sending.
     *
     * [HTTP Code **`422`**](http://httpstatus.es/422)
     * if the submitted resource could not be accepted due to erroneous parameters.
     * Please remember to validate all user input on your side before submitting
     * it to the API.
     *
     * [HTTP Code **`404`**](http://httpstatus.es/404)
     * if a requested resource could not be found. This might happen if
     * the resource has been deleted in the timeframe between selection by the
     * user and confirmation of the pledge by the client. In this case, either
     * contact your user and change the resource (most likely a project) or
     * redirect the donation to the client pool (the URL is provided by
     * betterplace.org).

     * **:lock: Only available if authenticated as a client.**
     * See [betterplace.org clients](../README.md#client-api).
     *
     *
     * ### Process Flow
     *
     * [This flow chart describes the process…](https://ixwphj.axshare.com/forwarding-request-flow.html).
     *
     *
     * ### What if the donation receiver is fully funded?
     *
     * The donation will be booked in the receiver account even
     * if the receiver is fully funded. The receiver will than show a
     * progress percentage > 100 %. For a project that means, the project
     * manager has to add new money needs to pay out the additional funds.
     *
     * Please note that closed projects are prohibited from receiving donations.
     *
     *
     * ### What if the donation receiver is prohibited from receiving donations?
     *
     * At the time when the forwarding request is received, the system does not
     * check the receiver status. Therefore the API will always respond with a
     * success message for all receivers.
     *
     * Should the receiver be prohibited from receiving donations at the time
     * when the donation is processed, the forwarding will not be inserted into
     * the system. The forwarding request will then be marked as "failed" and
     * the "error_reason" field holds detailed information about the problem.
     * Learn more at [Client Forwarding Request Status](client_forwarding_request_details.md).
     *
     * There are two possible next steps:
     *
     * _Option 1:_ Handle those cases manually with the betterplace.org-support-team.
     * This option is only feasible in selected cases.
     *
     * _Option 2:_ The client system reacts to the error-state of the
     * forwarding request automatically. For example by moving the donation
     * to a fallback project.
     *
     *
     * ### Response and error codes:
     *
     * [A list of all response and error codes](../README.md#http-status-codes).
     *
     * The most likely ones are:
     *
     * [HTTP Code **`202`**](http://httpstatus.es/202)
     * if a resource was successfully submitted for delayed processing.
     * A successful request will return HTTP status 202 (accepted). The
     * forwarding request is now saved and queued and will be processed
     * by background workers. This part takes place asynchronously and might
     * take up to a few minutes, especially in high traffic scenarios.
     * Please make sure that you queue and retry your API calls until you
     * receive clear answer (202, 422, 404, etc.) from us.
     * Note that we will book only one
     * donation per <code>client_reference</code> so there's no need to
     * worry about retrying the forwarding.
     *
     * [HTTP Code **`422`**](http://httpstatus.es/422)
     * if the submitted resource could not be accepted due to erroneous parameters.
     * Please remember to validate all user input on your side before submitting
     * it to the API.
     *
     * [HTTP Code **`404`**](http://httpstatus.es/404)
     * if a requested resource could not be found. This might happen if
     * the resource has been deleted in the timeframe between selection by the
     * user and confirmation of the forwarding request by the client. In this
     * case, either contact your user and change the resource (most likely a
     * project) or redirect the donation to the client pool (the URL is
     * provided by betterplace.org).
